;; This file contains utility functions and macros, taken from
;; let-over-lambda, which are used in the agutil project.  The only
;; modification is that the functions and macros have been moved from
;; the :let-over-lambda package to the :agutil package, and the
;; flatten function has been renamed to lol-flatten to avoid conflicts
;; with the flatten function from the alexandria package.

;; The components used, from let-over-lambda, are copied directly into
;; this project, as opposed to adding let-over-lambda as a dependency,
;; in order to remove some of the dependencies of let-over-lambda,
;; such as named-readtables, which do not work reliably across all
;; Common Lisp implementations.

;; This is a "production" version of LOL with bug-fixes
;; and new features in the spirit of the book.
